        <h2>About Puppies</h2>
        <p> A puppy is a juvenile dog. Some puppies can weigh 1–1.5 kg, while larger ones can weigh up to 7–11 kg. </p>
		<p id="hidden"> All healthy puppies grow quickly after birth. A puppy's coat color may change as the puppy grows older, as is commonly seen in breeds such as the Yorkshire Terrier. <br> Puppy refers specifically to young dogs, while pup may be used for other animals such as wolves, seals, giraffes, guinea pigs, rats or sharks. </p>
